### From JavaScript to TypeScript

*JavaScript today
Supports browsers decades past
Beauty of the web*

Before talking about TypeScript, we need to first understand where it came from:
JavaScript!

### History of JavaScript

JavaScript was designed in 10 days by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995 to be
approachable and easy to use for websites. Developers have been poking fun at its
quirks and perceived shortcomings ever since. I‚Äôll cover some of them in the next
section.

JavaScript has evolved tremendously since 1995, though! Its steering committee,
TC39, has released new versions of ECMAScript‚Äîthe language specification that
JavaScript is based on‚Äîyearly since 2015 with new features that bring it in line
with other modern languages. Impressively, even with regular new language versions,
JavaScript has managed to maintain backward compatibility for decades in varying
environments, including browsers, embedded applications, and server runtime's.

Today, JavaScript is a wonderfully flexible language with a lot of strengths. One
should appreciate that while JavaScript has its quirks, it‚Äôs also helped enable the
incredible growth of web applications and the internet.

### Vanilla JavaScript‚Äôs Pitfalls

Developers often refer to using JavaScript without any significant language extensions
or frameworks as ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù: referring to it being the familiar, original flavor. I‚Äôll
soon go over why TypeScript adds just the right flavor to overcome these particular
major pitfalls, but it‚Äôs useful to understand just why they can be painful. All these
weaknesses become more pronounced the larger and longer-lived a project gets.
